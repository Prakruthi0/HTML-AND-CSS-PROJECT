                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard language used to create web pages.
                 It's made up of various elements that structure content on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, 
                 links, images, and more. HTML uses tags to define different elements within a page. 
                 These tags tell the web browser how to display the content. 
                 With HTML, you can create the structure and layout of a webpage, 
                 which can then be styled and enhanced further using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and
                  made interactive through JavaScript.

                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and design the appearance of HTML elements on
                a webpage. It controls how things look, like colors, fonts, layout, and spacing.
                Instead of changing the structure of the content (like HTML does), CSS focuses on making things
                visually appealing. It works by targeting HTML elements and applying specific styles to them, 
                allowing for consistency and flexibility in the design across multiple pages of a website. 
                CSS lets you create beautiful, organized, and responsive layouts for your web pages.

                    JavaScript is a programming language that brings interactivity and dynamism to websites. 
                    It's used to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate elements, and respond
                    to user actions on web pages. Unlike HTML and CSS, which focus on structure and design,
                    JavaScript is all about functionality. It enables features like form validations, interactive maps, 
                    dynamic updates without reloading the page, and much more. Essentially, 
                    JavaScript adds life to web pages by making them responsive and interactive.

                    Java is a versatile and powerful programming language used in various domains, 
                    from software development to building mobile apps and web applications. 
                    It's known for its portability, meaning Java programs can run on different 
                    devices and operating systems without needing to be recompiled. It's an object-oriented language,
                    emphasizing the creation of reusable code and structured programming. Java is highly valued for its security features,
                    strong memory management, 
                    and its ability to create robust, scalable applications.
